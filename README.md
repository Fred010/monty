# STACKS, QUEUES - LIFO, FIFO

A stack is a container of objects according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle
In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed:
* push the item into the stack,
* pop the item out of the stack.

A stack is a _recursive_ data structure.

With same functionality, underlying stack structure is either array or linked list.

A queue is a container of object inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO).

In the queue only two operations are allowed
* enqueue
* dequeue.

The underlying structure for a queue could be:
* an array, vector, arrayList, linkedList, or any other collection.
